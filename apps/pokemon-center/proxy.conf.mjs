/**
 * Dev-server proxy for both GraphQL APIs.
 *
 * The frontend asks for `/api/champions/graphql`, never `http://localhost:3001/graphql`. That
 * indirection is what lets two checkouts run at once: an absolute port in the browser bundle
 * ties the app to exactly one backend, so a second worktree could build but never talk to its
 * own services.
 *
 * A module rather than JSON so the ports can be derived instead of edited. `.worktree-slot` is
 * written by `tools/worktree.mjs` and is untracked, which means this file — the one in git — is
 * byte-identical in every worktree and never shows up as a local modification.
